Phinshing Detection
# Title: Phishing Detection Web App

# Description:

This repository contains the source code for a web application that utilizes machine learning to detect phishing websites. It offers a user-friendly interface to submit URLs for analysis and provides real-time feedback on their legitimacy.

## Key Features:

Phishing URL Detection: Analyzes submitted URLs to identify characteristics commonly associated with phishing attempts.
Machine Learning Integration: Leverages pre-trained sentence transformers and machine learning models (specific model details to be added when implemented) to improve detection accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Flask and Dash for a smooth and intuitive user experience.
Real-Time Feedback: Provides immediate results on the likelihood of a URL being a phishing website.
## Project Structure:

app.py: The main Flask application file that defines routes, handles URL submissions, and interacts with the detection model.
requirements.txt: Lists all the necessary Python dependencies for the project.
templates (folder): Contains HTML templates for the web application's interface.
static (folder): Stores static assets like CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files.
models (folder, optional): Will contain the machine learning model definition and any related helper functions (if applicable).

(Optional) Configure Database:

If using a database for storing user data or analysis results, set up your database connection details in the application code.
## Run the application:

Open a terminal in the project directory.

Start the Flask development server:

### Bash
python app.py
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Access the application in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (default port, may vary).

## Usage:

Visit the web app in your browser.
Enter a URL in the provided field.
Click the "Analyze" button.
The application will display the results, indicating the likelihood of the URL being a phishing website.
## Disclaimer:

This is a sample project and may not be suitable for production use without further testing and security hardening.
Always exercise caution when dealing with potentially phishing websites.
## Development:

Feel free to contribute to this project by improving the detection model, adding features, or enhancing the user interface.
